<h2>The brief</h2> 
<p1>To create an application that creates 'Objects' that is made from a set of predefined rules. This will have to be accopmplished using the technologies and methodologies taught. </p1>
<br>
<h3>My application</h3>
<p1>My project is an application that generates a random skate trick and combining it with a stance.</p1>
<br>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<h3>Entity Relationship Diagrams</h3>
<h3>CI-pipeline</h2>
<h2>User Stories</h2>

<p1>To track the progress of the project and layout what was needed, Githubs project tracker was used to do this.</p1>


<h2>Testing</h2>

<h3>Unit Testing</h3>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Dynamic url for products, if the product is deleted, the user can still go to the page but displays nothing apart from the layout.html</li>
  <li>Gunicorn is deployed constantly</li>
  <li>Email says it succesfully sent email, but no email is recieved</li> 
</ul>

<h2>Future improvements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Allow for the user to filter styles of boards, length and price</li>
  <li>Allow for the user to see their orders</li>
  <li>Group the orders that were made in the same session and create a checkout for all items</li>
  <li>Improve the front end, and make it more visually appealing</li>
</ul>
